When you've reached the End Of File, 
you must store the current buffer in "line".
If the buffer is empty
  you must store an empty string in "line".

When you've reached the End Of File,
your function should keep 0 memory allocated with malloc 
except the last buffer that you should have stored in "line".

Make sure that your function behaves well when 
it reads from a file, 
from the standard output, 
from a redirection etc.
